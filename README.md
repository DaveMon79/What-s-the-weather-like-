# What-s-the-weather-like-

I was given the task of buliding a five day weather forecasting application which had to include the following functionalities

* Search for weather by city name
* Display todays weather
* Display 5 days forecast including weather icon
* Save searches to local storage and display on app
* when a saved search item is clicked, it will bring that cities weather information back up
* Colour code UV to show if level is safe or not



# Actions taken

This was our biggest project yet, with lots of funtionalities required which we'd not previously done. I broke the task down into stages, only moving on the next once it was completed. I also did a lot of research on how i was going to execute each task prior to writing any code. 


# Code Style

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Open weather API

# Difficulties

I experienced many difficulties buliding this weather application, most notably:

* Making API call - I expereinced a CORRS error which took a long time to debug
* Displaying the 5 day forecast in the pre built blocks
* Making the previous search history re-active when clicked



# Success

I'm very with the end result, given the difficulties I experienced buiding. I was able to get all functions working accpet the re-active search history. I was particulaly happy with the way the page looks beacause i wrote all the html and css myself.
